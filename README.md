<h1> Hello! I'm Rianna James </h1>
<br>

## ABOUT ME 

I'm a junior majoring in Computer Science at Boston University, with a passion for Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Web Development. After completing a summer course at Cornell on the foundations of machine learning, I became even more interested in how ML and AI are evolving into everyday tools and shaping the future of technology. Web development, especially front-end development, combines two things I love: design and coding. I love collaboration, learning new technologies, and continuously improving my skills through hands-on projects and internships. I'm looking forward to working on projects related to Machine learning/Artificial intelligence!
