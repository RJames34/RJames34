## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


 
## ðŸ§¡Hello! Welcome to my GitHub Profile, I'm Rianna ðŸ§¡
    
I'm a Computer Science major at Boston University with a passion for Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Web Development. After completing a summer course at Cornell on the foundations of machine learning, I became even more interested in how ML and AI are evolving into everyday tools and shaping the future of technology.

Web developmentâ€”especially front-endâ€”combines two things I love: art and coding! I'm enthusiastic about collaboration, learning new technologies, and continuously improving my skills through hands-on projects and internships.

If youâ€™re ever interested in connecting on these topics, feel free to reach out!
